      <p>Driver's Schedule is a simple application to help calculate Continuous Driving, Working Day and Minimum Rest times.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The main screen is grouped into 3 groups: Continuous Driving, Day and Minimum Rest. In each of them there are 3 cells that correspond to the start time, end time and the difference of the 2. In each row, by entering hours and minutes in 2 of the 3 cells and clicking the green button (play), calculate the third.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If we write the start and end time of the day it gives us the total hours worked.</li>
        <li>Another option is to give it the start time and the maximum number of hours day, the application would show the time at which we would have to finish.</li>
        <li>Another case could be writing the maximum hours of the day and the end time and get the time we should start.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>At the bottom there is the “Delete” button that deletes the content of all cells. Also a button that shows the current day that allows you to change it in case you want to save a screenshot to know which day it refers to.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The application has a light and dark mode, which is activated automatically according to the smartphone settings.</p>
